About this Course
In the final course, we'll tie together the concepts that you’ve learned up until now. You'll tackle real-world scenarios in Qwiklabs that will challenge you to use multiple skills at once.

First, we'll take a closer look at how to use external Python modules to extend your code's capabilities, and spend some time learning how to use documentation to learn a new module. For example, we'll use the Python Image Library (PIL) to create and modify images. We'll show you some simple examples of how to perform common tasks in the course material, but it will be up to you to explore the module documentation to figure out how to solve specific problems. 

Next, we'll show you how to communicate with the world outside of your code! You'll use data serialization to turn in-memory objects into messages that can be sent to other programs. Your program will send messages across the network to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offered by other programs. For those times when your code needs to talk to a person instead of a program, you'll also learn to send email messages. 

At the end of this course, you’ll be able to take a description of a problem and use your skills to create a solution -- just like you would on the job. In your final capstone project, you'll be given a description of what your customer needs, and it will be up to you to create a program to do it!

Course introduction
Hello, and welcome to the last course of this program!

Throughout this program, you've had the opportunity to learn and practice lots of different tools and techniques for creating and maintaining automation. You've learned how to write programs in Python, how to interact with files and processes from your Python scripts, how to track the history of your changes using Git, how to understand what's happening when the automation doesn't work as expected, and how to automate your infrastructure by using tools like Puppet. Phew, that’s a lot!

This last course will give you the opportunity to put all this new knowledge in action. You'll be given a bunch of small projects based on real-life scenarios, and you'll use Python to write the automation that will solve the challenges.

Working on these projects will give you the opportunity to start building your programming portfolio. When you’re done with each of them, you can upload the code you write to GitHub to show off your skills!

Since this course builds on top of everything taught in the other courses, you need to have working knowledge of the main concepts we covered: coding in Python, interacting with files and processes, using Git, using the Linux command line, troubleshooting problems, and working with Cloud infrastructure.

Throughout the course, we'll give you an introduction to the tools and techniques necessary for solving each of the projects. We recommend that you follow along by coding on your own computer. Coming up with your own exercises and practicing using the tools that you learn is the best way to master them.

One final note. As you probably noticed, this is a reading and not a video. :) This course is composed of readings that guide you along the path of using Python to solve real-life problems, along with labs that let you put that knowledge in action. We hope you enjoy the challenges and the new skills you gain along the way.
